# What is Metacity

**Metacity Suite** is a set of urban data synthesis, analysis, and **visualization tools**. We are developing several open-source tools:

* ****[**Metacity**](tools/metacity.md) is a Python package for urban data processing
* ****[**BananaGL**](tools-and-services/bananagl/) is a JavaScript 3D web visualization library for data preprocessed by `Metacity`
* ****[**DataAPI**](tools-and-services/dataapi.md) is a tile service hosted by us, providing GLTF models for the BananaGL library

There is also documentation for some of our older projects:

* ****[**AMOS**](projects/amos/) **** is a project targeted at developing a synthetic population based on data from the city of Prague
* ****[**Metacity Block Edition**](projects/blocks/) is a pitch for another project concerning urban data synthesis and simulation
