# What is Metacity

**Metacity Suite** is a set of urban data **synthesis, analysis**, and **visualization tools**. We are developing several open-source tools:

[**Metacity**](tools/metacity.md) is a Python package for urban data processing

{% content-ref url="tools/metacity.md" %}
[metacity.md](tools/metacity.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

[**BananaGL**](tools-and-services/bananagl/) is a JavaScript 3D web visualization library for data preprocessed by `Metacity`

{% content-ref url="tools-and-services/bananagl/" %}
[bananagl](tools-and-services/bananagl/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

[**DataAPI**](tools-and-services/dataapi.md) is a tile service hosted by us, providing GLTF models for the `BananaGL` library

{% content-ref url="tools-and-services/dataapi.md" %}
[dataapi.md](tools-and-services/dataapi.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

There is also documentation for some of our older projects:

* ****[**AMOS**](projects/amos/) **** is a project targeted at developing a synthetic population based on data from the city of Prague
* ****[**Metacity Block Edition**](projects/blocks/) is a pitch for another project concerning urban data synthesis and simulation
