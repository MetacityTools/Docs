# Metacity Block Edition

Modular Digital Twin for practical ‘what-if’ case scenario demonstrations and city planning

[PITCH DRAFT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194KfpQpHPrRZGCyp9wTWYtK17jtntt16AJgADumTH9I/edit?usp=sharing)

## Proposal

We propose modularization of the smart city digital twin (DT) into connected but separate blocks, based on existing infrastructure and urban neighborhood patterns. We utilize these blocks as building components that form a DT, rather than a set of intertwined layers or a convoluted and immutable city net. In the modular DT, each block can be subject to change, which results not only in different visuals, but also impacts other factors i.e. energy consumption, emissions, or commute times for residents in the area. This brings a significant level of gamification to the process of city planning and opens doors to visionaries who want to effectively demonstrate their ideas in a simple but impactful way.

To fulfill our idea we need to:

* Robustly assign city objects and their features into categories.
* Provide visualization with emphasis on one area of interest (commute, green spaces, noise, dust levels, temperature and so on).
* Establish neighborhood patterns capturing the local environments.
* Allow users to update a chosen neighborhood and explore the effects of their ideas.
