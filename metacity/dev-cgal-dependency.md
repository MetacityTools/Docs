# \[dev] CGAL Dependency

We are integrating CGAL into `Metacity` to facilitate more complex geometric operations. From version 0.7.0 you need to [install CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/download.html) before being able to develop locally.&#x20;

When you install `Metacity` from pipy.org, you do not need to install anything.
